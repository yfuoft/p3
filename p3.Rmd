{\bf Abstract}
\\
The American General Social Survey 2021 sheds light on various societal benchmarks. This paper extrapolates on this data and demonstrates that an almost linear model can be formed between age, family income, level of educational attainment, political party affiliations and political views, providing a more focused yet holistic view on American political opinion. This nigh-linear relationship is sufficiently accurate to make predictions about how individuals with certain characteristics are likely to vote.

## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
relevant_data <-
  raw_data %>%
    select(
      age,
      income,
      partyid,
      polviews
    )
    
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
